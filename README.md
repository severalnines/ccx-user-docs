This is the documentation for CCX, the cloud-native Sovereign DBaaS from Severalnines. You can use the public version of CCX, managed by Severalnines, [here](https://app.mydbservice.net/) or you can install it and run it on your own infrastructure. If you would like to do this, get in touch with us through our [website](https://severalnines.com/ccx/solutions/cloud-service-providers)

The documentation is provided in Markdown and the structure follows the [Divio documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/) as closely as possible.

The structure is as follows:
- `/` - The root level contains introductory information about CCX as a platform
- `How-to` - This directory contains guides for common tasks you may want to perform on CCX
- `Reference` - The bulk of the documentation lives here. This directory describes key features of the platform, supported systems and information on how certain tasks are performed
- `Technical` - This directory contains, or links to, documentation relating to the technical use of CCX. This includes the API and Terraform Operator
